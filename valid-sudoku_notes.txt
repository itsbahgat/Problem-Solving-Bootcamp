-This is a C# implementation of a solution to determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid.

-The method IsValidSudoku takes a 2D array of characters board as input.

-The first loop checks each row of the board to ensure that it contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.

-A HashSet<char> named row is created at the start of each iteration of the first loop.

-The second loop within the first loop checks each cell of the current row.

-If the current cell is not an empty cell ('.') and the cell's value is not added to the row HashSet<char>, the function returns false.

-The second loop checks each column of the board to ensure that it contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.

-A HashSet<char> named column is created at the start of each iteration of the second loop.

-The first loop within the second loop checks each cell of the current column.

-If the current cell is not an empty cell and the cell's value is not added to the column HashSet<char>, the function returns false.

-The third loop checks each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the board to ensure that they contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

-A HashSet<char> named subBox is created at the start of each iteration of the innermost loop within the third loop.

-The innermost loop checks each cell of the current sub-box.

-If the current cell is not an empty cell and the cell's value is not added to the subBox HashSet<char>, the function returns false.

-If all loops have completed without returning false, the function returns true, indicating that the board is valid.
