  <h1 align="center">Problem Solving Bootcamp 🚀</h1>
</div>

Welcome to our problem solving bootcamp repository! This is a project where a group of friends come together to solve problems and share their solutions. We follow a roadmap provided by [Neetcode](https://Neetcode.io/).

### Meeting Structure:
For each problem, we conduct a meeting led by a different member of the group, who is responsible for constructing the meeting and facilitating discussion. The goal of each meeting is to solve a problem together and share our different solutions.

### Repository Structure:

In this repository, each member has their own branch where they can push their solutions to the problems we solve. This allows us to track our progress and see each other's solutions.
